AirWaterFire – A React + Vite Mini-Game

A simple but polished browser game built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
Players choose between three elemental powers — Air, Water, Fire — and face off against the CPU’s random choice. Each element has strengths and weaknesses in a rock-paper-scissors style matchup:

🌬️ Air beats Fire

💧 Water beats Air

🔥 Fire beats Water

Features:

⚡ Fast build & hot reload with Vite

🎨 Styled entirely with Tailwind CSS

🖼️ Card-based UI with dynamic images for each power

🎲 Randomized CPU input and real-time results

🔄 “Play Again” button for instant rematches

This project is mainly a learning exercise in React state management and component design, but can also be a fun starter template for building simple decision-based games.
